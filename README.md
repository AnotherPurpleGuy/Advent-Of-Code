# Advent-Of-Code

These are my answers to the "Advent of Code" programming challenges written in
JavaScript

The coding done here is for the purposes of demonstrating my ability to use
JavaScript and solve problems using computer science principles. As such the
solutions do are not necessarily focused of giving the best coding solutions
possible. That is to say they are not focuses of the solutions that require the
"fewest lines of code" or solutions that "run the fastest".
